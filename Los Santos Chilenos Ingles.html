<br>
 <p><h2><i>For humanity she is an indisputable proof that the call of Christ to be saints is actual, possible and true. She stands before our eyes to demonstrate that the radicality of the following of Christ is the only thing that is worthwhile and the only thing that makes man happy.</h2></p></i>

 <p><h2><i>She was born in Santiago de Chile on July 13, 1900. At the baptismal font she was called Juana Enriqueta Josefina de los Sagrados Corazones Fernández Solar. Familiarly she was known, and is still known today, by the name of Juanita.</i></h2></p>

<br>

<br>
 <p><i><h2>He was born in Viña del Mar in an impoverished aristocratic family. When he was four years old, his father died, leaving Alberto and his younger brother in the care of their mother, with whom they moved to Santiago, Chile.</h2></i></p>

 <p><i><h2>From a very young age, his only vocation was the priesthood. He studied law at the Pontifical Catholic University, graduating at the age of 22. Only days after finishing that career, he entered the Jesuit novitiate in Chillán, initiating himself in the profession that was his genuine vocation.</h2></i></p>

 <p><i><h2>His ordination to the priesthood took place in Louvain, Belgium, many kilometers away from Chile. His stay in Europe was intensely used for the study of subjects that would train him to achieve one of the goals he most desired: working with young people. In 1936 he returned to Chile as a brand new doctor in Psychology and Pedagogy to teach religion classes in what had been his school during his primary and secondary education: San Ignacio. Thus began a life of intense work, in which the teaching profession would be only one of his many fronts of struggle.</h2></i></p>
